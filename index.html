        An Intelligence Quotient (IQ) test is a standardized assessment designed to measure human intelligence relative to a population. In other words, the term  <br>"intelligence quotient" (IQ) refers to a test that evaluates a variety of cognitive skills and yields a result that is meant to be a gauge of a person's <br>intellectual capacity. IQ tests have become a widely accepted tool for assessing cognitive abilities, problem-solving skills, and mental reasoning. 
        <br><br>
        IQ tests are based on the principle that intelligence can be quantified and expressed as a single number that reflects cognitive abilities. The average score on <br>an IQ test is set at 100, with most of the population scoring within a range of 85 to 115. Scores above 130 are generally considered to indicate high <br>intelligence, while scores below 70 may signal cognitive challenges. 
        <br><br>
        The questions in an IQ test typically cover a variety of areas, including numerical reasoning, logical reasoning, verbal intelligence, and spatial intelligence. <br>Numerical reasoning tests an individual's ability to work with numbers and solve mathematical problems. Logical reasoning assesses pattern recognition <br>and the ability to make sense of complex sequences. Verbal intelligence focuses on understanding language, word relationships, and analogies. <br>Spatial intelligence involves the ability to visualize and manipulate objects in space, which is important for activities like reading maps or solving puzzles..</p>
